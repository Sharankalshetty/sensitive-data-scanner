# sensitive-data-scanner
The Sensitive Data Scanner is a web-based tool that allows users to upload files and automatically scan them for sensitive information such as PAN card numbers, Social Security Numbers (SSNs), credit card numbers, and medical records. 
The tool identifies and classifies sensitive data into categories like Personally Identifiable Information (PII), Protected Health Information (PHI), and Payment Card Information (PCI). 
The results are stored in a database and can be accessed via a user-friendly web interface, where users can view, manage, or delete scanned data. The tool provides RESTful APIs for retrieving scan details and integrates with a relational database to store the scan results. 
Designed to be easy to use, the application also includes features like data classification, secure storage, and future extensibility for machine learning-based data identification.
